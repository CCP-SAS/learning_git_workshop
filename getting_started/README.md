For instructions on installating and setting up Git on you computer (one time per machine), refer to [section 1.5](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [section 1.6](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) of Pro Git.

As mentioned in [Tower's Version Control Best Practices](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/content/02-cheat-sheets/01-git/git-cheat-sheet-large02.png), "Branching is one of Git's most powerful features."  The key benefit to branching is that it helps you avoid mixing up different lines of development (new features, bug fixes, ideas, etc).  When working in a group, it can be helpful to name your branches using your username, the issue number it addresses, and a human readable note.  In the instance where there is not already an issue related to what you are working on, please create an issue to accomodate discussion and tracking of pertinent comments.  As an example branch name, say I want to work on something related to the issue [Always work in branches #1](), a good branch name might be `stvn66_1_motivating_why_use_branches`.

Working in branching presents one complication in keeping track of which branch you currently have checked out.  Whenever you checkout a branch, the Git application on your computer changes the file tree to match that branch.  A consequence of this is people can easily forget which branch they are/were working in most recently and inadvertently make changes in the wrong branch.
