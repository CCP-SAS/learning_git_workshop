# Learning Git: a hands-on workshop

[Code School](https://www.codeschool.com) provides a nice [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) intro course for getting started with Git.  GitHub also provides a useful [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide for getting started with Git, though this requires having Git installed, which we describe later in the [getting started section](https://github.com/CCP-SAS/learning_git_workshop/tree/master/getting_started).  [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=learn-git&utm_medium=navigation&utm_campaign=learn-git) also some useful resources at no charge, a more extensive [video course](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/videos#episodes), an [on-line ebook](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/introduction), and cheat sheets on [Git commands](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/content/02-cheat-sheets/01-git/git-cheat-sheet-large01.png) and [Version Control Best Practices](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/content/02-cheat-sheets/01-git/git-cheat-sheet-large02.png). Another great resource is the book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and available under the [Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
